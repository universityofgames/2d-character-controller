# 2d-character-controller

If you are starting your adventure with the Unity3D engine, you will definitely need a 2D character controller. We have prepared a quick-to-implement solution for a character controller that can walk and jump. This controller based on custom physics with collisions and does not handle sloped surfaces - only flat ground or vertical walls. Nevertheless, it is a perfect example of taking the first steps.
